<h2> About Me </h2>
<hr/>

<big>Hi, my name is <b>Muiz Sohani</b>. I am working towards a Bachelor of Applied Science in <b>Biomedical Engineering</b>.</big>

<h3>Engineering</h3>
<hr>

<p style="text-indent:40px"> My interest in biomedical engineering comes from the direct impact it has on people's lives. As an engineer I hope to design and develop devices and systems that are <b>non intrusive solutions</b> to medical issues that people face in their daily lives. Whether it's designing prosthesis or developing subtle devices to monitor blood sugar levels, each project holds potential to improve the lifestyle of someone affected. </p>

<h3>Mental Wellness</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">When I'm not caught in the hustle bustle of being an engineering student, I like to take initiative to promote <b>mental health awareness</b>. It's obvious that positive mental health is incredibly important for everyone to work towards. Just like the biomedical field, advocating for mental health caught my attention because it has a positive impact on people's daily lives.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<p> I've been able to take steps to help in the fight against the stigma by starting a council that advocates for positive mental health. The <b>Student Wellness Council</b> works to increase the accesibility to metnal health aid for students through the development of innovative wellness programming and mental health initiatives.</p>
