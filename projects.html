		<h2>Design Projects</h2>
		<big>I had the opportunity to collaborate with 4 other Biomedical Engineering students to design, prototype and test a sensory based toy. We designed a toy to aid children with non-verbal autism devlop their communication skills in a home environment through play.</big>

		<!-- images of it styllll-->
		<p>The toy was to engage the user by having them interact with various environments. These environments had phrases associated with them which the user would listen to and practice to develop their vocabulary.</p>
